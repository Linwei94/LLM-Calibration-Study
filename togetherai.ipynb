To clearly resolve these energy levels, their energy difference should be such that it satisfies the condition derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty principle, ΔΕ * Δt >= h/4π, where ΔΕ is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n",
