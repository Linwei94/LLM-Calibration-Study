      "```Explanation: To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. The uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of a state to the uncertainty in its energy by ΔΕ * Δt >= ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.58 * 10^-16 eV*s).\n",
