If one lands on heads, the other *always* lands on tails, and vice versa.  You didn't pre-determine the outcomes; they're decided only when you flip the first coin.\\n\\nThat's kind of like quantum entanglement.\\n\\nInstead of coins, we have tiny particles like electrons.  They can be \\\"linked\\\" in a special way, so that even when separated by vast distances, measuring a property of one instantly tells you the corresponding property of the other, regardless of the distance.  It's as if they communicate faster than the speed of light, which is very strange and defies our everyday understanding.\\n\\nThe important thing is that the particles don't have definite properties until you measure them.  It's only when you measure one that the properties of both are determined, instantaneously, even if they are light-years apart.  This \\\"spooky action at a distance,\\\" as Einstein called it, is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.  We don't fully understand *how* it works, but we know it does.\\n\"\n",
