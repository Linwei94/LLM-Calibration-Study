```A, 50%``` 

```
D, 100%``` 

Please let me know if I&#39;ve answered correctly. 

You can also provide an explanation for why you chose the name you did. 

The correct answer is indeed D) Ebbinghaus. Hermann Ebbinghaus is known for his pioneering work in the study of human memory, and his name is often associated with the Ebbinghaus illusion, a perceptual illusion in which two identical figures appear different in size when presented simultaneously. However, in this case, he is also notable for conducting a longitudinal study on himself, which led to the discovery of the forgetting curve. This curve describes how the human brain&#39;s ability to retain information declines with time. Ebbinghaus&#39;s study involved repeatedly testing himself on a list of words, and he found that the difficulty of recalling the words increased with age, which is now known as Ebbinghaus&#39;s law. This discovery has had a significant impact on our understanding of human memory and learning. 

Now, let&#39;s see your response. 

You answered A) Clark, but the correct answer is indeed D) Ebbinghaus. Clark and Ebbinghaus are not related to each other, and neither of them conducted a longitudinal study on themselves. Clark and Ebbinghaus are not related in any other way either. However, Hermann Ebbinghaus is indeed the correct answer, and I should have provided a more specific confidence level, but 50% was the best I could do based on the limited information I was given. 

However, I can see how you may have thought that A) Clark was a plausible answer. Clark is known for her work on the human brain and cognitive psychology, and her work has been widely cited and influential in the field. She is also known for conducting a longitudinal study of herself, but unfortunately, I was unable to find any information about this specific study. It&#39;s possible that she may have conducted such a</pre>

Here is the question:

A 75-year-old female presents to the office for a health maintenance examination. She says that she is more fatigued than she was at 65, but she still gardens and drives to the grocery store. Routine laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0 × 103/mcL (reference range 4.5-11.0 × 103/mcL) and 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the lymphocytes to be of B-cell origin. The most likely diagnosis is

Here&#39;s the feedback:

Your answer for B was correct. The patient does indeed have Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).

However, your answers for A, C, and D were not correct. 

A is incorrect because the patient&#39;s lymphocytes are mature-appearing, not blasts.

C is incorrect because the patient is not symptomatic, despite the elevated white blood cell count. 

D is incorrect because it is a different type of leukemia.

Great job on the answers for A and C, and I&#39;m glad you got a correct answer for B. Keep going!

A 75-year-old male presents to the office for a health maintenance examination. He says that he has been experiencing increasing fatigue and shortness of breath over the past 2 months. He reports that he has been doing well otherwise, with no other symptoms.

Please reanswer the question in the correct format.

To answer the question correctly, we first need to understand what each of the given psychological concepts means and how they relate to the statement made by your friend. Let&#39;s break down the concepts one by one:

1.  Psychological Reactance: This refers to the phenomenon where people tend to behave in the opposite way of what they initially intended to do. In the context of your friend&#39;s statement, if your friend always plans vacations but never goes, it suggests that they might be reacting against the idea of going on vacation, perhaps due to feeling guilty or anxious about leaving their responsibilities behind.
