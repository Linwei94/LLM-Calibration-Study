This question refers to the following information.
&#34;The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.&#34;
Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Which of the following best explains Mao&#39;s concept of the &#34;socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture&#34; in China?

A) Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers.
B) Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production.
C) Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities, raising the standard of living across the whole of China.
D) Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.</pre>

A married couple sued a real estate broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract in failing to live up to promises he made regarding the couple&#39;s purchase of a residence. They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn&#39;t pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker&#39;s agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?

A) The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party&#39;s authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.
B) The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.
C) The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.
D) The testimony is admissible  even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.</pre>

According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:

A) from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.
B) since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.
C) our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.
D) since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.</pre>

A man attended a convention at a hotel, but did not get a room. One evening armed security officers detained him and accused him of stealing. According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him &#34;wandering aimlessly&#34;, and at times &#34;suspiciously&#34; handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man&#39;s paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?

A) No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.
B) No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.
C) Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.
D) Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established  there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.</pre>

A mechanic agreed in writing to make repairs to a landscaper&#39;s truck for $12,000. The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper&#39;s promise to pay the additional $2,000?

A) No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic&#39;s wrongful threat.
B) No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.
C) Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.
D) Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.</pre>

This question refers to the following information.
&#34;Since the foundations of the American commonwealth were laid in colonial times over 300 years ago, vigorous complaint and more or less bitter persecution have been aimed at newcomers to our shores. Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The &#34;Know-Nothings,&#34; lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day….But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers…..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst—a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War—Poland and Italy.&#34;
Robert H. Clancy, Congressional Record, 68th Congress, 1st Session, 1924

Read the following excerpt.
Never were talents of the highest genius of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.
—John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855
Which of the following actions of Napoleon does the author seem to be ignoring the hypocrisy of in his examination of the high mindedness and praiseworthiness of Napoleon?

Consider a computer system in which processes can request and release one or more resources. Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released. If a process requests a resource that is already in use, the process enters a queue for that resource, waiting until the resource is available. Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock?

A) Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority
B) Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all
C) Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number
D) Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting</pre>

How have the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as international financial institutions (IFIs), affected the development of poorer countries?

A) Financial policies advocated by the World Bank and IMF were readily adopted by developing countries that sought to bring their economic development into line with wealthier nations. The IFIs focus has been on achieving human security and the promotion of development at a societal level.
B) Through the implementation of specific financial policies adopted at the bequest of global financial institutions, many developing countries have gained economic prosperity and the correlating levels of human security.
C) The World Bank and IMF tend to operate in an economic arena that includes only major financial institutions and wealthy states; coupled with a respect for sovereignty, the scope of such institutions does not reach to interference in national politics.
D) IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems. Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.</pre>

A state law required vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. A church in a city located in the state wanted to acquire larger facilities for its school. The city&#39;s school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building, at a price below its fair market value, to the church for use as its school. If enacted, would this law be constitutional?

A) No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B) No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
C) Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.
D) Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.</pre>

A defendant is on trial for robbing a particular bank with his best friend. The friend has left the country and cannot be found. The prosecutor has called the friend&#39;s mother to testify to a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She implored him not to go, but he said, &#34;Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don&#39;t want them to catch me.&#34; The prosecutor has other evidence indicating that the defendant and the friend were together on the morning of the robbery. Is the statement by the friend to his mother admissible?

A) No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.
B) No, because the friend&#39;s statement to his mother was not corroborated.
C) Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.
D) Yes, as a statement of the friend&#39;s state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.</pre>

A group of residents sued a neighboring strip club for creating a nuisance. There are continuous nightly activities by the club, including loud music, unruly customers, throwing cans and bottles,urinating in public, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism. The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club defends that it cannot control its customers after they leave the premises, and it reminds the court that it has zoning approval. Its approval, however, is based on a grandfather clause that allows it as a non-conforming use  otherwise, the area surrounding the club is strictly residential. Will the court likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor&#39;s problems?

A) No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.
B) Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous  an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.
C) No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.
D) Yes, the activities of the club constitute an attractive nuisance that interferes with the public at large and must be abated.</pre>

A construction company was doing repairs and replacing portions of a sidewalk and railing next to a lake. The construction crew started tearing out the old sidewalk and railing, but stopped work when it started to get dark. The construction crew left without putting up a warning sign or barrier around the work area. A few hours later, a jogger came along the sidewalk. Not realizing the construction work was in progress there, the jogger stumbled and fell at the spot where the construction crew had torn up the sidewalk and railing. The jogger fell into the lake. As the jogger was attempting to stay afloat, he began screaming, &#34;Help! Help! I can&#39;t swim. I&#39;m drowning. &#34; His screams attracted the attention of a person who was passing on his bicycle. The cyclist immediately hurried to assist the jogger. As the cyclist was leaning over the edge of the lake, trying to help the jogger get out of the water, he lost his balance and fell into the lake. Both the jogger and cyclist suffered serious bodily injuries before they were pulled out of the water by police. In a negligence action by the cyclist to recover for his personal injuries, the construction company will most probably

A) be held liable, because the cyclist&#39;s attempt to rescue the jogger was foreseeable.
B) be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs.
C) not be held liable, because the cyclist assumed the risk by leaning over the edge of the lake.
D) not be held liable, because the construction company could not foresee that anyone would be hurt while trying to rescue someone from the lake.</pre>

A student at a private university was receiving financial aid from the university based on a financial aid application he completed at the time of his enrollment. During finals at the end of the fall semester, the student was caught cheating. His chemistry professor saw him looking at a fellow student&#39;s exam paper and copying the answers to three multiple choice questions. The professor notified the honor committee, which immediately found an honor code violation and ordered that the student receive a failing grade in the course. In addition, in accordance with the rules of the university, the student&#39;s financial aid was terminated. The student filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of his financial aid. The student&#39;s only argument was that his due process rights were violated in that he did not receive a notice of, or a hearing on, the alleged honor code violation. Which of the following facts, if true, would be most helpful to the student?

A) The university was in financial difficulties and could not meet its payroll expenses.
B) The university did not re-allocate the student&#39;s financial aid to another deserving student.
C) The university received support from the state.
D) The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.</pre>

What external strategies do elites employ?

A) An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.
B) Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.
C) An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.
D) Weak states may sometimes militarily engage in action to bolster their regional position and to mobilize internal support against the construction of an imagined external threat. This frequently coincides with economic or social crises as a policy of distraction.</pre>

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following excerpt.
The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.
—Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820
The final result of the negotiations led by Metternich during the Congress of Vienna is being referenced in the document above in which of the following ways?

A) Metternich&#39;s statement about the military despotism of Bonaparte led to the elimination of all empires in Europe.
B) Metternich&#39;s statement about fulfilling duties indicated his support for the Holy Alliance that controlled the fate of Europe.
C) Metternich&#39;s statement about the unity of monarchs alludes to the creation of the Concert of Europe.
D) Metternich&#39;s disgust for secret societies led to the creation of the Carlsbad Decrees.</pre>
