    <pre>Explanation: Since both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, they must be homozygous recessive for the disorder. Each parent can only pass on the recessive allele to their offspring. Therefore, all of their children will inherit two recessive alleles (one from each parent), making them affected.

    <pre>Explanation: To determine which of the following is likely to have a demand curve that is the least elastic, we need to consider the factors that affect the elasticity of demand. Demand elasticity is influenced by the availability of substitutes, the nature of the good (necessity or luxury), and the market structure. A demand curve is least elastic when there are few or no close substitutes for the product, making it less sensitive to price changes.

    <pre>Explanation: Calculate the total number of pieces completed by adding the pieces from each day: 45 + 41 + 49 + 47 + 43 = 225. Then, multiply the total number of pieces by the piece-rate basis of 80 cents, or 0.80: 225 * 0.80 = 180.
