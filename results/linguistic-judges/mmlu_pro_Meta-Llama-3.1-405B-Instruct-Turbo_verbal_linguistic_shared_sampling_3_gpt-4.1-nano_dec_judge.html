    <pre>Explanation: Autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. If both parents are affected, they are both homozygous recessive (rr). The possible genotypes of their offspring are rr, as each parent can only contribute the recessive allele. Therefore, all offspring will be affected.

    <pre>Explanation: To determine which demand curve is the least elastic, we need to consider the factors that affect elasticity. Elasticity is influenced by the availability of substitutes, the degree of necessity, and the level of differentiation. A demand curve with many close substitutes will be more elastic, as consumers can easily switch to alternatives. A demand curve for a necessity good will be less elastic, as consumers are less responsive to price changes. A demand curve for a monopoly firm&#39;s output will be less elastic, as there are no close substitutes.
